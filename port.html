                    Diabetes_prediction_System</h3>
                <p>Diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged
                    period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger.
                    If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic
                    ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include
                    cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.
    
                    This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
                    The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based
                    on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the
                    selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at
                    least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
    
                    Objective
                    We will try to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the
                    dataset have diabetes or not?
                    Details about the dataset:
                    The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor
                    variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so
                    on.
    
                    Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
                    Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
                    BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
                    SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
                    Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
                    BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
                    DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
                    Age: Age (years)
                    Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
                    Number of Observation Units: 768
    
                    Variable Number: 9
    
                    Result; The model created as a result of XGBoost hyperparameter optimization became the model with the
                    lowest Cross Validation Score value. (0.90)</p>
